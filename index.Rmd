## Bio

I'm an internal medicine resident at [VUMC](https://www.vumc.org).
I will be started as a fellow in the [division of rheumatology](https://medicine.vumc.org/rheumatology-and-immunology) in July 2022.
Generally, I'm interested in learning about normal function and diseases of immune system for the benefit of my patients (and others).
I believe detailed study of the adaptive immune system's receptor repertoire, without losing sight of germ line genetics and environmental exposures, will provide rewarding insights.
I've also recently become interested in identifying and analyzing natural experiments.
