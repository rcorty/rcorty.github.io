## Bio

I'm a rheumatology fellow at [VUMC](https://www.vumc.org). I'm currently
focused on learning about the diagnosis and management of rheumatologic
disease. I'm also learning about normal immune function, with the goal
of better understanding how derangements lead to rheumatologic disease,
and the ultimate hope of advancing our ability to diagnose and manage
these conditions.
