## Bio

I'm a rheumatology fellow at [VUMC](https://www.vumc.org), learning about the diagnosis and management of systemic auto-immune disease. In the research setting, I'm examining the clinical consequences of somatic genetic variation with the goal of improving our understanding of the etiology of idiopathic auto-immune and auto-inflammatory diseases.
