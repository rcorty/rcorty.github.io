## Bio

I'm an internal medicine resident at [VUMC](https://www.vumc.org).
I will be started as a fellow in the division of rheumatology in July 2022.
Generally, I'm interested in learning about the immune system for the benefit of my patients (and others).
One approach that has captured my imagination recently is 'natural experiments'.
